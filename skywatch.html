                - Light pollution from cities can washout starlight and make it
                difficult to observe the night sky. It is best to travel away
                from the city for your best chance at seeing the most stars.

              <dd class="smaller-font">
                - Even the moon can cause light pollution that drowns out the
                stars. Going stargazing during a new moon ensures that the sky
                is at its darkest and you will have the best chance at seeing
                the most stars and other astronomical objects.

                ⋆ Check the Transparency
              </dt>
              <dd class="smaller-font">
                - In astronomy, transparency is the measure of how clear the
                atmosphere is. Dust,smoke,haze, humidity and light pollution all
                play a role in the transparency of the night sky. Transparency
                tends to gets better with altitude,because you're looking
                through less air. Transparent is also usually high after a
                rainstorm, after the storm has cleared out all the particles in
                the air. You can visit

              <dd class="smaller-font">
                - Be sure to travel away from tall buildings that can block your
                view of the night sky. Try moving to a higher location such as a
                mountain top or a lookout point for the best possible view.

                - Quite possibly the most anticipated astronomical event of
                2021. A total lunar eclipse is when the Sun,Earth and the Moon
                align perfectly, creating a lunar eclipse. In North America only
                part of the eclipse will be visible;however you can view the
                total eclipse from the High Plains, Pacific Coast or the Rocky
                Mountains.

                - The Perseids will be on of the most spectacular meteor showers
                of the year. The Perseid meteor shower will be visible from July
                17 to August 24 and will reach its peak on the night of August
                11-12. During the peak you will have the chance to see up to 60
                meteors per hour if conditions are just right. The best time to
                watch for meteors will be between midnight and dawn. Make sure
                to give your eyes about 30 minutes to adjust to the dark for
                your best chance at catching a glimpse at the meteors.

                - On December 4 the final eclipse if 2021 will take place.
                Unfortunately the total eclipse will only be visible from the
                continent of Antarctic. Although only a lucky handful of people
                will be able to witness the total eclipse,astrophiles living in
                South Africa, Namibia, and Botswana, as well as Tasmania and
                southern parts of New South Wales as well as Victoria in
                Australia will have the chance to catch a smaller partial
                eclipse.
