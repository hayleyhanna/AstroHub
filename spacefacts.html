            "Eye of God" nebula due to its striking resemblance to an eye.

          <p class="smaller-font">
            An exoplanet or an extrasolar planet is a planet detected outside of
            our solar system. To date there are more than 4,000 exoplanets that
            are considered to be "confirmed". Astronomers calculate that for
            every star in our galaxy there is roughly one exoplanet.

          <p class="smaller-font">
            The event horizon is the boundary that marks the limits of a black
            hole.At the event horizon the escape velocity is equal to the speed
            of light.General relativity states that nothing can travel faster
            than light,meaning nothing inside the event horizon will ever be
            able to escape beyond it,including light.

            In 2011 astronomers found an enormous water vapor cloud about 12
            billion light-years from Earth.The cloud is the oldest and largest
            source of water<br />in the universe that we know of.The water
            inside is equivalent to 140 trillion times the amount of water found
            in the Earths oceans.

            The Sun's surface area is 11,900 times that of Earth's.It holds
            99.8% of the solar system's mass and is roughly 109 times the
            diameter of Earth. The Sun is so large that if you squished as many
            Earth's inside of it as you could without any wasted space you would
            be able to fit around 1,300,000 Earths.

          <p class="smaller-font">
            Thought to be powered by super massive black holes,Quasar's are
            among the most distant object in the visible universe.Quasar's emit
            extreme amounts of energy. Even though Quasars are millions of light
            years away, we are still able to observe them due to the amount of
            energy and light they produce(some thousands of time brighter than
            entire galaxies).

            How Long Can a Human Survive in Space Without A Spacesuit?
          </h2>
          <p class="smaller-font">
            Attempting to float through space with out a spacesuit is not
            recommended. While you would not explode or freeze instantly
            contrary to popular belief.You would most certainly not make it out
            alive.The biggest dangers you will encounter are lack of oxygen and
            embullism.Embullism is the formation of bubbles in the bodily fluids
            due to extreme reduction in the surrounding pressure. As previously
            mentioned the other danger is lack of oxygen. After about 15 seconds
            you would lose consciousness.Holding your breath in this situation
            would cause big trouble.This is because the vacuum of space would
            pull any remaining air from your lungs, causing them to rapture.
